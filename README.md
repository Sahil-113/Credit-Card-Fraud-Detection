Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By leveraging supervised learning techniques and advanced data preprocessing methods, the model effectively identifies anomalies in transactional data to prevent fraudulent activities.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified patterns and trends in transaction data to understand the distribution of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.
Class Imbalance Handling: Addressed the skewed dataset using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
Model Implementation: Applied machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting.
Performance Metrics: Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, imbalanced-learn
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
Dataset
The dataset used is a publicly available credit card transaction dataset, containing features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized variables.
The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only a small percentage of transactions labeled as fraudulent.
Key Insights
Successfully built a model to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy and minimal false positives.
Visualized the impact of various features on the prediction outcomes.
Demonstrated the importance of handling imbalanced data for better model performance.
How to Use
